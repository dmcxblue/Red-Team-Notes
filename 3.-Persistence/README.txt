This folder mostly contains references for Persistence Methods, I added a few tools that can help,
for finding and exploiting a few of the weaknesses for this category.

Most of this category just contains methods on how to achieve Persistence there is no special tool to achive this
just various enumeration one's or helpers to build the proper binary but nothing extraordinary
